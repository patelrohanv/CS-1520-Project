Started college at the University of Pittsburgh on a pre-med track planning to do a triple major in Neurosciene,
Philosophy, and History and Philsophy of Science. I realize now that this was an incredibly foolish idea on my part.
During this year I started volunteering at UPMC Shadyside Hospital and did research under Dr. Amit Sethi while he was studying
recovery of movement among stroke patients. I also joined the South Asian Student Association as a Freshman Chair and joined my 
fraternity, Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity Inc.
