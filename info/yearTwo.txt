This year saw the transition of me from the pre-med track to pursuing something new. I also began working in the Swanson School
of Engineering in the Technology Group working on providing helpdesk support, I first tried out studying
Economics but ultimately decided to switch to Computer Science after re-realized my passion was in technology and that
I enjoyed writing code to solve problems.
