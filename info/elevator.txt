My name is Rohan Patel. I am currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh studying computer science and I am on track to finish my degree the summer of 2017. I enjoy learning more about and have a passion for technology; specifically, how it can be leveraged to advance and how it interects with other industries/fields.
